#Game No. 1: Solid Foundations

This is a very simple framework provided to aid the learning and developing of simple 2D games for the Microsoft Surface.  The language we use is C# due to it's excellent compliance with Visual Studio and Windows 8.

###Don't use this if:
- You've never done programming before. (go learn it.)
- You've never had experience with Object-Orented-Programming languages.
- You are looking for a kickass game engine that does everything for you.
- You have no interest in making a game.
- You don't read XKCD. (you've GOT to be kidding...)

###How to start:

Download, Clone, Copy&Paste, or using what ever method you prefer (as long as you don't burn my house down) to obtain a FULL COPY of the repository.  Put it at a place that is easily accessible and isn't dangerous.  I generally put my projects in a folder called ```C:/Projects/``` for convenience.

(e.g. ```~/My Documents/``` folder is okay.  ```C:/Windows/System32/GroupPolicy/``` is probably a horrible idea and should be frowned upon.)

Open the project by opening the file ```[that-folder]/ExampleGame1/ExampleGame1.sln``` 

You should be opening it with Visual Studio.  If youo are not, you either should do more research or tell your school to stop hiding dreamspark from their students.
