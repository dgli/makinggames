#Game No. 1: Solid Foundations

This is a very simple framework provided to aid the learning and developing of simple 2D games for the Microsoft Surface.  The language we use is C# due to it's excellent compliance with Visual Studio and Windows 8.

###Don't use this if:
- You've never done programming before. (go learn it.)
- You've never had experience with Object-Orented-Programming languages.
- You are looking for a kickass game engine that does everything for you.
- You have no interest in making a game.
- You don't read XKCD. (you've GOT to be kidding...)

###How to start:

Download, Clone, Copy&Paste, or using what ever method you prefer (as long as you don't burn my house down) to obtain a FULL COPY of the repository.  Put it at a place that is easily accessible and isn't dangerous.  I generally put my projects in a folder called ```C:/Projects/``` for convenience.

(e.g. ```~/My Documents/``` folder is okay.  ```C:/Windows/System32/GroupPolicy/``` is probably a horrible idea and should be frowned upon.)

Open the project by opening the file ```[that-folder]/ExampleGame1/ExampleGame1.sln``` 

You should be opening it with Visual Studio.  If youo are not, you either should do more research or tell your school to stop hiding dreamspark from their students.


###An explaination of what's here:
In your solution explorer  (the window that's to the right of your editor window after you open the solution) are a few folders. 

-The Assets folder contains material to be used by microsoft to make your app purrty.  Logo, label, etc.
-The Content folder is where you will put your game resources; such as images, sound effects, etc.  Try to stick to this convention.  It's a nice one.
-The code is put directly under the ```ExampleGame1``` project folder for your convenience.

####Try it. Unlike you it doesn't bite.
Open the ```GameMain.cs``` file.  This is where the game is for now.  This is a simple game, so all the stuff is contained in this file for now.  Run the game.  Try to figure out what everything is doing.  Try to change stuff around.

####Protip:
If your computer can handle it without smoking, run the game in a simulator.  This way you can actually see the output as you click and stuff on the screen.


THAT"S ALL! MORE WILL BE ADDED LATER.  (oh so you saw that double quote huh? yeah I did that on purpose.s)
